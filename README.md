# Sleep Analysis with Garmin Data

## Overview

Analyzed 4 weeks of Garmin sleep data. Raw CSV was cleaned with **Python (pandas)** and visualized with **Tableau Public**.

Key questions:

* How long did I sleep (Garmin vs. Bedtimeâ€“Wake calculation)?
* How efficiently did I sleep (% of time in bed actually asleep)?
* Am I meeting the 8-hour goal (sleep debt)?

---

## Tools

* Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Tableau Public
* GitHub for versioning + documentation

This dashboard includes:
- Sleep Duration Trend (Garmin vs. Bedtimeâ€“Wake)
- Sleep Efficiency Over Time
- Sleep Debt vs. 8-Hour Goal

## Insights

* Garmin undercounts sleep by ~0.5â€“1.5 hrs vs. raw bed-to-wake.
* Avg sleep efficiency â‰ˆ 85%.
* Sleep debt builds on weekdays, weekends show catch-up.
